# MarketPal — Starter ASP.NET Core Razor Pages site

This workspace contains a minimal, nicely styled Razor Pages site under `MarketPal.Web`.

Prerequisites
- .NET SDK 8.0 or later (install from https://dotnet.microsoft.com)

Run locally

```bash
cd MarketPal.Web
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

Then open https://localhost:5001 or the URL shown in the console.

Notes
- Project is intentionally minimal (Razor Pages + static CSS). Add components, APIs, and front-end tooling as needed.
