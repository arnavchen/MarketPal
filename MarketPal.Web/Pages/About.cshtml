    <h2>About MarketPal</h2>

    <p>Hi — I'm Arnav. I built this small site to teach myself two things: web development with <strong>.NET</strong> and the basics of stock market indicators such as moving averages. This project is a learning playground where I can prototype simple visualizations and experiment with data.</p>

    <h4>Contact</h4>
    <p>You can reach me on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/arnavchen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@@arnavchen</a>. Please update this page with your preferred contact details if you'd like a direct email or other link shown.</p>

    <h4>Purpose</h4>
    <p>The website is intentionally educational. The Market Tracker demonstrates moving averages (MA50 and MA200), how to visualize them, and how a simple MA crossover can hint at trend direction. It does <em>not</em> provide trading advice. Everything here uses demo data by default to avoid accidental use of live trading data or keys.</p>
